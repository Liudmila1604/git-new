Look at me
I'm not the man I used to be
When she smiles at me
I live the light I used to see
There she goes, and I know
on my own I'm not home
Can't believe she can't see
That she's taking the best part of me

I'm half a man with half a heart
With nothing left to tear apart
Half of me is walking 'round
the other half is on the ground
